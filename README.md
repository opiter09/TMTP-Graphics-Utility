# TMTP_Graphics-Utility
This set of Python scripts converts graphics from Too Much Tingle Pack (and the other Tingle games) to Nitro formats and back. The goal is to be the
missing link in the process described in my Text Editor repository: https://github.com/opiter09/TMTP-Text-Editor.

Once you turn graphics into NCGR/NCLR/NCER/NANR, you can open and edit them using NitroPaint: https://github.com/Garhoogin/NitroPaint.
